This is where all of your resources will go such as images, ModTheSpire json config file, and custom strings
you may use for your mod. (I suggest looking at how other mods use their resource file. A list of mods is found at
the wiki for ModTheSpire)

An example ModTheSpire.json config is in this folder. Change it to match your needs. A more detailed explanation about
this file can be found on the ModTheSpire GitHub.
